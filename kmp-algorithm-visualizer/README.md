- Highlights matches, mismatches, and LPS jumps
- Clean, interactive UI for better understanding


## About KMP

The Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) algorithm is an efficient string matching technique that avoids redundant comparisons by preprocessing the pattern using the LPS (Longest Prefix which is also Suffix) array. This visualizer helps demonstrate how KMP uses the LPS array to achieve linear time matching.
